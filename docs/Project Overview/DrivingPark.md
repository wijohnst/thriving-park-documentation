Founded in 1892, Driving Park is a hardworking community on the south-east side of Columbus, Ohio. Bound by Interstate 70 on the north and Whittier Street to the south, Driving Park is so named for its historic racing venue, first for horses and later for automobiles. Today the neighborhood is home to almost 18,000 residents.
