ThrivingPark is the official [neighborhood operating system](NeighborhoodOperatingSystem.md) for [Driving Park](DrivingPark.md), an historic, diverse, and vibrant community on the south-east side of Columbus, Ohio.

The technical goal for the application is to build web-based tools to positivily impact the neighborhood and increase the social and environmental well-being of our neighbors.

In addition to the project's technical and social goals, ThrivingPark also seeks to be a training ground for engineers at all levels. Our all-volunteer development teams works in a model that we call a [Standing Dev Team Simulation](StandingDevTeamSimulation.md). The Dev Team Simulation is by its nature inclusive and provides growth opportunities for all skill levels. If you'd like to join our team please consider joining our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/thrivingparkcom/shared_invite/zt-15o1eym03-gLeAh5_LxCKt8dLTm0_q~g).
