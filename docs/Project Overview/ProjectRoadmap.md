## **Overview**

 ThrivingPark.com is a [Neighborhood Operating System](craftdocs://open?blockId=D0EDED81-016E-4003-892C-8C09E481C838&spaceId=35b7910a-02c9-b6ae-7bc0-106a5eab9e46) for the Driving Park community in south-eastern Columbus, Ohio. ThrivingPark will be a collection of helpful and easy-to-use tools designed to increase the social, environmental, and cultural well-being of the area. To accomplish this we have broken the project into two main phases.

## **Phase 1: Component Library and Essential Feature Set**

 We are starting small but thinking big in this first phase. Our initial efforts will be focused on two key areas:

- The ThrivingPark Component Library
- The “Essential Features”

### **The Component Library**

 These components encompass the basic building blocks of any application and include things like input fields, forms, modals, and notifications as well as the many standard visual elements found in any modern web app. We don't know what specific features the community will request, but we can be certain that it will require the aggregate functionality of the Component Library.  
  
The priorities for building the component library are:

- *Accessibility -* Are neighbors are all different and those difference deserve to be honored and celebrated. This extends to ability. Our components will strive to meet the needs of as many people as possible.
- *Reusability* - By building our components in isolation before we know their specific use case we can ensure that we are building the least coupled, most cohesive UI elements possible. By focusing on reusability we can ensure faster delivery of the features that are important to Thriving Parks users.
- *Continuity* - It is important that we provide a well-organized and cohesive experience for our users. This extends to both the visual language and functionality of the components that comprise the application. We believe that by focusing on a Component Library before focusing on implementation we can avoid the functional and creative drift that plagues components that are built to fulfill often narrow requirements.

### **Essential Features**

 This describes our vision for what the app can “do” in its first phase. Because we are letting community engagement and inquiry guide our development efforts (see Phase 2), we only need to implement those features that aide in this inquiry. For Phase 1 we will implement:  

- **Basic user functionality**

  - Creating a user profile

  - Updating that profile

- **Community Polling**

  - Ability to ask the user base questions

  - Ability to record their answers

 With the ability to [1] create users and [2] ask them what tools they’d like to see implemented we can ensure that we are only building features that our users really want.

## Phase 2 - Building What the Community Wants

 In Phase 1 we built a component library and features to ask our members what tools they’d like to see implemented in the application. So naturally, Phase 2 (and all future phases of development) are about implementing those features. We wish that we could go into further detail about those features at this time but unfortunately, we don’t know what we are building yet!

 What we can say is that these features, whatever they may be, will be geared towards making life in Driving Park more equitable, healthy, and fun!
