> _"My first day as a professional engineer, I don’t remember being overly worried about my skills writing JavaScript. I was nervous about all of the things that I couldn’t practice as a solo, self-taught developer. The Standing Dev Team Simulator is designed to practice the many skills that professional engineers use on a day-to-day basis."_ - __Will Johnston, Technical Lead, Thriving Park__

 In addition to it’s pro-social goals, DrivingPark.com is intended to simulate the professional developer experience for pre-career engineers. By adhering to professional best practices we seek to expose pre-career engineers to many of the non-technical tasks that they will likely experience when they transition to a professional setting. These best practices include but are not limited to:

- Code Reviews
- Stories / Tickets
- Coding from designs
- UX research
- Unit Testing
- Release management
- CI/CD
- Git-as-a-group
- Documentation
- Atomic Design
- Test-Driven Development
- Story-Driven Development
