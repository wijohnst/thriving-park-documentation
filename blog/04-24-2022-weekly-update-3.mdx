import Table from '../src/components/Table/Table.jsx';

After a few weeks of slower progress we are right back into the swing of things! Here’s what we were able to accomplish last week as well as some changes for the week ahead.

## New Team Members


We are happy to welcome Qadriyyah Johnson and Jessica Wang to the project this week! Qadriyyah and Jessica are both recent graduates of the We Can Code It bootcamp and we are really thrilled to have them joining the team. We look forward to working with you and seeing your contributions to Thriving Park! (Also, if you haven’t said hello to them in Slack please shoot over a welcome message!) 

**Project Roadmap**

If you haven’t seen it yet, please check out the [Project Roadmap](https://thrivingparkdocs.netlify.app/docs/Project%20Overview/project-roadmap) on the DOCS site. This page outlines the Stage 1 and Stage 2 goals for Thriving Park, including the Component Library and the "essential" feature set. This high level planning is typical of a professional project and serves as a source of truth and tool for developers to understand what's important. We will use this roadmap to guide out "boots on the ground" decision making over the coming weeks and months. 

**Standing Dev Team Simulation**

This week we also added a new page to the DOCS site that outlines the [Standing Dev Team Simiulation](https://thrivingparkdocs.netlify.app/docs/Project%20Overview/standing-dev-team-simulation) and how that guides our technical and non-technical work on Thriving Park. As we continue to work together and mature as a development team I'd love to hear your suggestions for ways we can expand the simulation and ensure that we are practicing all of the essential skills that you will all need as you start your careers as professional engineers. 

**Application Updates**

Here’s the week in numbers:

Shoutout again this week to Will Cary for his work in updating the `ParkSign` component to more semantic HTML as well as working to make that component more responsive on non-desktop screen widths. 

**Open Issues**

We’ve got lots of open issues if anyone is looking to pick something up. 


- ThrivingPark UI Repo - [Issue #145](https://github.com/wijohnst/thriving-park/issues/145) - This is a simple find and replace story to correct a spelling mistake in one of the variables. This is a great issue for someone new to the project to get a feel for the main UI code base. 
- DOCS Repo - [Issue #33](https://github.com/wijohnst/thriving-park-documentation/issues/33) - Updating the `useMedia` hook to `useMediaQuery` to match the implementation in UI repo. Slightly more technical than the issue above but still a great issue for a new contributor. 
- DOCS Repo - [Issue #32](https://github.com/wijohnst/thriving-park-documentation/issues/32) - Our first `spike` story! This is a research issue asking for an outline of best practices for responsive styling for the DOCS repo. This is a more involved issue but is great practice for performing the kind of research and planning that is very common on a professional dev team. If you’d like to pick up this story please let me know and we can talk in-depth about what goes into completing a `spike`.

**The Coming Week** 

This week we will start working in earnest again on the main application. The DOCS repo / site is in a good place for now and its time to start concentrating again on work for the component library. Please keep an eye out for new issues in that repo! I’ll be online Monday (4/25) for office hours and some live coding, so if you’re interested in joining please let me know!

As always, this project would be nothing without all of your great contributions! Thank you all for your hard work and here’s to another great week in Thriving Park!

-Will
