I’m going to try and make this a weekly thing, but here goes our first weekly update for the week ending Sun, Mar 27.
  
## New Team Members

We’ve added several new members to the team this week. Kevin is a full-stack JavaScript engineer and full-time good human. Pedro is an experienced open-source contributor who is enthusiastic about helping others learn. Both Kevin and Pedro are joining the team in mentoring / senior engineer capacity.  
  
Robbie is another familiar face joining us from the Free Code Camp Columbus community. He is a React developer who, when he isn’t mastering all-things JavaScript, is cutting up the floor at his local roller rink.

I want to send my personal thanks to each of our new teammates for volunteering their time and talent to make this project a success. 

## Application Updates

We made some big strides this week, especially with respect to our new documentation site which is  [now live]([https://thrivingparkdocs.netlify.app/](https://thrivingparkdocs.netlify.app/)). Not only is this proving to be a great introduction to our project for new teammates and project supporters, but Docusaurus is providing great opportunities for working in React. 

Here’s the week in numbers:

Special shoutout to Will C. and Pedro for merging their first commits to this repo. Thank you for your hard work!

## First Office Hours a Success

On Saturday we held our first office hours. Office hours are an opportunity to ask questions, get clarification on requirements, and pair code on challenging problems. Huge shoutout to Robbie who let me talk his ear off for two hours about Git and Typescript! If there is continued interest from the group we can continue to hold office hours as often as needed. 

## The Week Ahead

The goal for this coming week is to continue our efforts on the documentation site. I’m currently working on what I’m calling the “Project Overview” section which outlines various high-level topics related to ThrivingPark. 

Here are some other open issues related to the documentation effort: 


- [Issue #21](https://github.com/wijohnst/thriving-park-documentation/issues/21) - Update `Sidebar` to show `Project Overview` items in correct order
- [Issue #22](https://github.com/wijohnst/thriving-park-documentation/issues/22) - Add reusable `Table` component
- [Issue #23](https://github.com/wijohnst/thriving-park-documentation/issues/23) - Refactor `<ParkSign />` component to be reactive 

Also, next week I’m going to work on the Product Roadmap. This document will layout my vision for the Version 1.0 release of ThrivingPark. Please keep an eye on Slack for this announcement, because this will unlock lots of exciting work on the main front end and backend repos. 

## Final Thoughts

This was by far the most productive week that we’ve had on the project so far. I think we should all feel proud of our trajectory and how much we’ve been able to accomplish. This is an inspiring team to be a part of and I want to thank you guys for giving me the opportunity to do this work with you. Now let’s go crush this week!
